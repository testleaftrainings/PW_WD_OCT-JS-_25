# Test Annotation :
---

--> Control the behaviour of the execution.

hooks -> The execution flow before and after the actual test execution.
------
test.beforeAll --> before all test it will be executed
test.beforeEach --> before each test it will be executed
test.afterEach -->  after each test it will be executed
test.afterAll --> after all test it will be executed


test.beforeAll() -> Storage State

test.beforeEach() -> Data Parameter

test() -> Create Account

test() -> Create Lead

test.afterEach() ->  title,status

test.afterAll() -> report upload



Test Annotation
---

test.only --> focus on a specific test.
test.skip --> ignore the test from execution
test.fixme --> track and know failures that are yet to be fixed
test.fail --> for negative testing --> test has to fail is the expectation
test.slow --> triple the timeout of the tests execution --> 30 s --> 60 s for the entire test execution
test.describe --> grouping the test depending on the status of the other test.
test.use -->use the functionalities

test.describe->
serial -> depending on the test ->  any one test is failed -> it will stop execution
squential -> execute test one by one
parallel -> any test failed , other test will execute

//test.describe -> group of test cases

//test.describe.serial -> to run the test cases in serial manner -> if any one test is failed . it will
//stop the execution of next test cases (depends-on)

//test.describe.parallel -> to run the test cases in parallel manner -> if any one test is failed . it will
//not stop the execution of next test cases

//test.describe.squential(default) -> to run the test cases in sequential manner -> if any one test is failed . it will 
//not stop the execution of next test cases
