SwitchCase: 

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions,
 as an alternative to multiple if...else if...else blocks.
 Syntax:


switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code block
    break;  // once condition satisfied end execution
  case value2:
    // Code block
    break;
  ...
  default:
    // Default code block
}

ex:

let browserName ="ie"

switch(browserName){

case "edge":
console.log("edge browser")
break

case "chrome":
console.log("chrome browser")
break

default:
console.log("No browser")
}

//output: chrome browser


Looping Statements:

for Statement: The for loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over a range of values or to 
repeat a block of code a certain number of times. It consists of three parts: 
initialization, condition, and iteration expression. The loop continues as long as 
the condition is true.


Initialization – Executed once before the loop starts.

Condition – Checked before every iteration; loop runs as long as it's true.

Update – Executed after each loop iteration.

Example:

for(initialization;condition;iteration){

}
iteration:
i++ -> post increment => i+1
++i -> pre increment  => 1+i

let num=10

for(let i=0;i<=num;i++){
console.log(i)
}

i=0;0<=10;0+1  => i=1
i=1;1<=10;1+1  => i=2
i=2;2<=10;2+1  => i=3

i=10;10<=10;10+1 =>i=11
i=11;11<=10 -> false -> stop execution

output:
0
1
2
3
4
5

7
8
9
10


 
         Jump Statements:

break Statement: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When encountered inside a loop,
 it immediately terminates the loop, and the control is transferred to the statement following the loop.

 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  //0,1,2,3,4,5
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // Exits the loop when i is 5
    }
    // Code inside the loop
}


continue Statement: The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for 
the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        continue; // Skips the rest of the code for i=5 and continues with the next iteration
    }
    // Code inside the loop
}
//0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

switch case
let day=4
case-> monday, tuesday,wednesday, thursday, friday and default 
 output -> thursday


For loop

ClassRoom:
Input -> 30
print Odd number 0 to 30
use for loop
use if condition
print Value




String:

* its collection of Characters
declare 2 types

Type 1:
String Literal // store the value in String constant pool memory its part heap memory
let name="Dilip"
let val="Dilip"
same memory address

let val="dilip" ->

Type 2:
String Object // directly it store value inside heap memory 
let comName= new String("Testleaf") -> 398
let name1=new String("TestLeaf") -> 547

Declaring a String:
Single quotes -> '   '
Double quotes ->"  "
BackTicks ->  ` `

let n1="Dilip @ 123"
let n2='dilip'
let n3=`dilip`

Methods: 
1.length -> find total number of characters
index value -> start form 0
console.log(n1.length) -> 5 ->0-4
